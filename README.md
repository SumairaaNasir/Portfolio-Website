# Sumaira Nasir Portfolio Webpage
This portfolio webpage, titled "Sumaira Nasir | Portfolio," is a personal project designed to showcase my skills, experience, and passion as a Python developer, web scraper, and freelancer. As a BSIT student, I’ve crafted this site to highlight my expertise in web scraping, automation, and web development, utilizing tools such as Python, Selenium, WordPress, HTML, and CSS. The goal is to create a professional platform to connect with potential clients, collaborators, or employers while reflecting my ongoing learning journey.

The webpage is structured into several key sections:

•	**Header and Navigation:** A sticky navbar provides easy access to the "About," "Skills," "Projects," "Video Demo," and "Contact" sections.

•	**Main Section:** Features an engaging introduction with my name, title (Python Developer | Web Scraper | Freelancer), and a "View my work" button, enhanced with a dynamic background image and animation.

•	**About Me:** Offers a detailed bio, a list of highlights (e.g., Python and Selenium skills, data handling expertise), and a downloadable resume link.

•	**Skills:** Includes a table detailing my proficiency levels and years of practice—2 years with Python (Intermediate), 1 year with Web Scraping (Intermediate), and 1.5 years with HTML & CSS (Beginner).

•	**Projects:** Showcases three projects—Portfolio Website, Web Scraping Bot, and WordPress Site—with descriptions and key features.

•	**Video Demo:** Integrates a YouTube tutorial video demonstrating basic HTML and CSS concepts.

•	**Contact:** Provides a form for inquiries, collaborations, or feedback, along with email and social media links (LinkedIn, GitHub).

•	**Footer:** Includes a copyright notice for 2025.
